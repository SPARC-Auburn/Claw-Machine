# Claw-Machine
As an outreach project for the Southeastern Center of Robotics Education (SCORE), SPARC has been tasked with design and manufacturing a robotic claw machine.  The claw machine is intended to be very similar to one that you would find at a mall except it will be designed with the intention that everyone wins.
